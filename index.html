    <h1>A 50-Year Website</h1>

    <p>What would it mean to build a website that would last 50 years?</p>

    <p>Every page should stand alone:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>no libraries</li>
      <li>no shared styles</li>
      <li>no shared code</li>
      <li>duplicate everything</li>
      <li>static everything</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Each page should essential be an archive, a folder with an index.html
      file.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the opposite of building a maintainable site. We don't want a
      50-year site to be maintainable, we want it to maintenance-free.
    </p>

    <p>
      You could build the site with just markdown files, and use a static site
      generator to build it up, but that&#39;s a thing that can break. Yeah, you
      could rebuild a new site with another generator from the original
      markdown, but would you want to?
    </p>

    <p>
      If everything broke one day, would you go through the effort to fix it
      before adding more content? Or would you give up on it?
